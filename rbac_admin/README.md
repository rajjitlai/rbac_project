# UI for Dynamic RBAC System with Multi-App Integration

## Project Overview

This repository contains the frontend user interface (UI) for the **Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System with Multi-App Integration**, developed as part of a 4-day (96-hour) interview task. The UI supports two mini-applications:

- **Shopping App**: Features for browsing products, adding to cart, and checkout.
- **Todo App**: Features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items.

The UI is built using **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling, managed via **Vite** for a fast development experience. It integrates seamlessly with the backend RBAC system to enforce authentication and permission-based access.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Integration**: Fetches data from a Node.js backend with Sequelize and SQLite

## Features Implemented

### Shopping App UI

- Product selection dropdown to add items to the cart
- Create new product functionality
- Cart display with added items
- Checkout button with confirmation

### Todo App UI

- Form to create new todo items
- List view to read existing todos
- Edit and delete options for individual todos

### General UI Features

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates via API calls
- Authentication integration (login/register forms)
- Permission-based visibility (e.g., restricted buttons for unauthorized actions)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajjitlai/rbac_project
   cd rbac
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Ensure the backend is running (see backend README for setup).
   - Update `src/config.js` (if exists) with the backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

4. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the app.

### Build for Production

1. Build the optimized production bundle:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve the build output (e.g., using a static server like `serve`):

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve -s dist
   ```

## Integration with Backend

- The UI communicates with the backend API endpoints (e.g., `/products`, `/todos`) using `apiService` calls.
- JWT tokens are stored and sent with requests for authenticated actions.
- Permission checks are enforced via backend middleware, reflected in UI state.

## Testing

- Manually test UI components by interacting with the Shopping and Todo apps.
- Use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests and verify API responses.

## Deployment

- Deploy the `dist` folder (generated by `npm run build`) to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- Ensure the backend API is accessible via the configured URL.
